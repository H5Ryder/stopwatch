# React + TypeScript + Vite Stopwatch

Live Demo: 

To run use the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Functionality:
- Start/Stop
- Lap
- Reset
- Save image of recorded laptimes

Todo:
- time updating 100fps - too many re-renders -> Increase interval time
- Add elements that don't update often to a separate component
- Fix sine wave function made on blue markings around circumference of watch (to have a wave effect), commented out for now
